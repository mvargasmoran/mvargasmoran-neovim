Just Training Wheels for while I get comfortable using nvim

* Regular useful shortcuts
* Usual functionality all editors should have (nvim version)
** Movements
    By Word:
        forward <w>
        backward <b>
** Useful Deletion Yanking
    A whole word

** Window stuff (also known as splits also known panes)
    Splits
    <C-w><C-v> Vertical split
    <C-w><C-s> Horizontal split
** Tab stuff
    Open a new tab
        :tabe ~/file/path
        :tabedit ~/file/path
    Move between tabs forward & backwards (just give them a try)
        <gt>
        <gT>
** Selection Stuff
    To select parts of text we have VISUAL mode 
        <v> "Enters Visual mode
        <C-v> "Enters Visual Block mode (something like rectagle edit)
* Functionality that made me install that one plugin (all of them)
** Telescope
** YouCompleteMe
** UndoTree
* Navigation 
** Open a file in the current directory
    Open Explore (Netrw) in a vertcal Split
    :Vex

    Open Explor in a horizontal Split
    :Sex

    Explore opens directories, then files
    :Ex
    :Explore

    Edit by preference shows files
    :e
    :edit

    Maybe you want Tabs
    :tabe
    :tabedit
    but this won't let you explore a lot, just offers tab key completion for paths

    Maybe you need splits
    :split

    The nice thing is that it let's explore just like edit
