# mvargasmoran-neovim
My personal, completely NOT stolen neovim configuration.

#### What does it have?
I has several stuff from The popular Theprimeage's streams.

but just for it has:
  - **Too many keybindings** :
    `liuchengxu/vim-which-key`
  - **Telescope** :
    Now that's nice
  - **Undo History**:
    `mbbill/undotree`
  - **Cut & paste history** (kinda):
    `tversteeg/registers.nvim`
  - **Git interactions**:
    `tpope/vim-fugitive` Mr Tpope. 10+ years of fugitive
  - **Multiple Cursors**:
    `mg979/vim-visual-multi`
    I'm an Emacs guy so I need that kind of stuff (I know that I can do macros, but I won't)
  - A quicker mode to **jump in horizontal**:
    `phaazon/hop.nvim` But I'm just trying it I also didn't use emacs ace-jump that much.
  - Nice Icons
    `kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons` This needs [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

```
nvim-lua/popup.nvim
nvim-lua/plenary.nvim
neovim/nvim-lspconfig
